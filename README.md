# Team Arcade @ Legends of Lightning

Code & docs for Team Arcade, participating in the [Legends of Lightning tournament](https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview).

We are competing in the **Global Adoption** track. We aim to maximize global adoption of Bitcoin and Lightning.

## What we're building

A location-based social app with a fun 3D map.

Think "Pok√©mon Go" for real-world commerce, powered by Lightning and Nostr.

It will be a cross-platform app for Android, iOS and web built in React Native.
